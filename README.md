# XPipe Vault (Keep this repository private!)

It works! The git remote push succeeded. However, no connections have been pushed to this git repository yet.

## Adding connections to the repository

By default, no categories are set to shared so that you have explicit control on what connections to commit.

To have your connections of a category put inside your git repository,
you either need to right-click the category or click on the `⚙️` icon when hovering over the category
in your `Connections` tab under the category overview on the left side.
Then click on `Add to git repository` to sync the category and connections to your git repository.
This will add all shareable connections in that category to the git repository.

## Local connections are not synced

Any connection located under the local machine can not be shared as it refers to connections and data that are only available on the local system.
